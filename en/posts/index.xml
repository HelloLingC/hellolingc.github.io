The post also covers the Phantom Process Killer in Android 12, providing ADB commands to disable it. For VNC access, the author installs the XFCE desktop environment and configures the VNC server to allow connections beyond localhost.

They encountered some issues, such as global exception handling and JSON parsing, and chose to use Picasso to load images. To solve the problem of images being too wide in the WebView, the author adjusted the image size through JavaScript. In the end, the author completed the basic loading and viewing functions and shared the code on GitHub. Despite the challenges in the development process, the author still enjoyed the experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
